# TASK 5 README:

## the usage of /dev/loop in this task:

It is used to mount an SD card image or any disk image on Linux, /dev/loop is used to associate a loop device with a file. A loop device allows a  regular file to be mounted as if it were a block device, such as a  physical disk or partition. This is particularly useful when working  with disk images.

When you run a command like sudo losetup /dev/loop15  /home/rana/sd.img, you are creating a loop device /dev/loop15 and associating it with sd.img.This allows you to access the contents of the file as if it were a block device.
